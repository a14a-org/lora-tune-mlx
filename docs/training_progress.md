# LoRA Training Progress Summary

## Progress So Far (March 2024)

### Initial Training (1-step)
- Trained model for 1 step
- Training loss: ~2007.95
- Validation loss: ~2006.81
- Generated coherent responses but limited training

### 100-step Training
- Extended training to 100 steps
- Training loss progression: 2008.94 â†’ 2008.91
- Validation loss: 2008.90
- Checkpoint saved at: `lora_checkpoints/checkpoint-100.npz`
- Model performance:
  - Input processing: 86.29 tokens/sec
  - Generation speed: 3.15 tokens/sec
  - Memory usage: 19.24 GB
- Response quality: Well-structured, contextually appropriate

### Observations
- LoRA successfully applied to q_proj and v_proj in all layers
- Total trainable parameters: 112
- Model maintains coherent responses
- Loss values remain relatively stable

## Next Steps

### Extended Training (300 steps)
1. Update config:
```json
{
    "training_config": {
        "max_steps": 300,  // Increased from 100
        "eval_steps": 20,  // Keep current evaluation frequency
        "save_steps": 100  // Save checkpoints every 100 steps
    }
}
```

2. Continue training:
```bash
python train_lora.py --config config/lora_qwen_config.json --start-step 100
```

3. Expected checkpoints:
- `checkpoint-200.npz`
- `checkpoint-300.npz`

4. Testing plan:
- Test each checkpoint with the same prompt
- Compare response quality and performance metrics
- Monitor loss progression

### Key Metrics to Track
- Training loss trend
- Validation loss at checkpoints
- Generation speed
- Response coherence and relevance
